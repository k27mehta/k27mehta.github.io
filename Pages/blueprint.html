                <a href="https://www.blueprintsys.com/storyteller">Storyteller</a> is a powerful requirements solution that allows users to collaboratively author, validate, 
                and manage requirements for software projects. It also provides integration capabilities with other applications such as Jira. 
                The application is designed for anyone who authors or works with requirements otherwise known as artifacts, including but not limited to: business and system 
                analysts, architects, developers, quality assurance analysts, business stakeholders and customers.
                <br><br>
                As mentioned, an artifact refers to a requirement in the Storyteller product. The application supports a variety of base artifact types, 
                including: textual requirements, use cases, UI mockups, business process diagrams, generic diagrams, storyboards, documents, and glossaries.

                <br><br>

                With more product insight, it was understood that version compare would be an essential feature as it will automate analysis instantly by
                visualizing changes between artifact versions.

                                            <h3 class="case-study-small-title">Solutions Explored</h3>
                                            To better understand which design solution to go with, I explored the user experience and considered the risks associated 
                                            with each design. Some users liked the inline version compare design, but some preferred to see both versions side-by-side. 
                                            After various discussions with the product and engineering teams, I decided on the single panel design solution as it:
                                            <ul style="list-style-type: square; font-size: 16px; padding-top: 20px;">
                                                <b>
                                                <li>easily fit into the UI frame provided in the Storyteller application</li>
                                                <li>required for less development work as the side-by-side view would result in more code change </li> 
                                                <li>and was consistent with the application I was building for, which was one of my <a href="#goals" class="link-ui">initial goals.</a></li>
                                                </b> 
                                                </ul>
                                        </div>

                                        <div style="padding-top: 20px; width:97%;">
                                            <h3 class="case-study-small-title">Feature implementation</h3>
                                            Once a design solution was selected, it was important to understand the work behind the feature. Front-end libraries were explored to ensure that the feature's functionality worked as promised to user. 
                                             <br><br>
                                            <b>Edge cases</b> were important to consider as the Storyteller product allows users to create lists, tables, lists within tables, and other cases. 
                                            It is essential to understand how version compare would work for all use cases in order to prioritize requirements for the minimum viable feature.
                                            <br><br>
                                            
                                            Considering these edge cases, the front-end developers and I decided to use DaisyDiff, a Java library in order to implement this feature into the Storyteller application.
                                            We analyzed how the DaisyDiff library performed under the various edge cases looking at the differences in text. The library perform well for the basic use cases such as understanding textual changes in lists, tables, and plain text. Despite having some bugs that didn't associate with the major use cases, the library was chosen as it went above and beyond by capturing style changes.

                                            <h3 class="case-study-small-title">Iterative Design Process</h3>
                                           Before breaking down the user requirements and technical user stories for the version compare feature, I analyzed the new user experience with quick mockups on Figma. 
                                           Here I realized that the user experience could be kept consistent if existing components in the Storyteller application were reused.                                               
                                           <br>
                                           <br>
                                           <b>Reusing components</b> was important as it creates a consistent user experience. 
                                           <br>
                                           <br>
                                        
                                            The Relationships Tab consisted of the expand details arrow link and a checkbox for each relationship card which could be used for the History Tab version cards to implement
                                             the version compare functionality. Previously, the <a href="#version-card">version cards</a> had to be individually selected and had no checkboxes to indicate which two cards were selected for the version compare feature. Hence, reusing of Relation Tab components would decrease 
                                             development time.

                                            In addition to these design changes, workflow changes were required so that the user is able to select two version cards in order to perform version compare.
                                            This became a complex issue as checkboxes are a symbol of multiple selection but the version compare functionality would only occur if two version cards were selected.

                <h1>Solution</h1><br>
                Through iteration it was understood that the version compare feature would be more consistent with the whole application if it reused components found in other Utility Panel tabs such as the Relationship Tab. I explored several different solutions and workflows before coming up with a proposal. Inspired by the application Ritual which I used to order my lunch meals, I found a way to keep the application consistent with checkboxes while comparing two versions at a time. 
                <br><br>
                Using Ritual almost every other day provided for a user experience that I found useful in building out the version compare feature. When I used to select my salad toppings, I realized that once I had exceeded the limit of toppings for the meal then the UI automatically deselected the first topping I chose. This user experience was suitable for the version compare feature as the user could select multiple versions but the version compare icon would only occur on the last two versions selected. 
                <br><br><br><br>
                <div>
                    <video class="video-border" autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" muted="" style="width: 400px;">
                    <source src="../Images/ritual_feature.mov">

                </div>
                <br><br>
                The version compare feature became a solid feature using existing components and the slection concept discovered using the Ritual application. The selection concept was used to select version cards for comparsion. 
                When two versions were selected then the History tab header would display icons. These icons included the version compare and merge feature. The revert icon was placed on the bottom left of all but the latest version, so that the user can easily revert to any version easily.
                <br><br>
                <br><br>

                <div>
                    <video class="video-border" autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" muted="" style="width: 900px;">

                </div>
                <br><br>

                The final solution included the version compare modal which was built resuing artifact's user interface. As seen in the video, the modal for version comparison looks similar to
                the user interface behind the modal with comparsion shows in red and green. The merge functionality was labelled as 'Restore Select Values' which was another reused component from the Relationships tab.
                This modal highlighted key property changes and allowed the user to merge two different versions. The user is also provided with a summary of the merges in the 'Summary' tab of this modal.
                Essentially, this merge modal was easy to reuse as it captured essential values that users would look at when comparing two different versions.

                One of the main features for this feature set was revert, which allowed the user to restore all values of a previous version. When writing out the user stories for this feature, I realized that all but the latest version 
                could be used as a possible version that a user would like to restore. If there is only one version then reverting was not an option. To simplify the experience, reevert icons were in all but the latest version. 

                <br><br>
                Additionally, use cases that were raised during user interviews were considered. For example, some stakeholders wanted a simple version comparsion between any version selected and its pervious version.
                To capture this use case, I made use of the version cards and the expand button in order to provide major details that highlighted changes between a version and its previous state. 
                These major details included relationship, property, and files (attachments and documents) changes with count.

                    Once a design solution was selected, it was important to understand the work behind the feature. Front-end libraries were explored to ensure that the feature's functionality worked as promised to user. 
                     <br><br>
                    <b>Edge cases</b> were important to consider as the Storyteller product allows users to create lists, tables, lists within tables, and other cases. 
                    It is essential to understand how version compare would work for all use cases in order to prioritize requirements for the minimum viable feature.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Considering these edge cases, the front-end developers and I decided to use DaisyDiff, a Java library in order to implement this feature into the Storyteller application.
                    We analyzed how the DaisyDiff library performed under the various edge cases looking at the differences in text. The library perform well for the basic use cases such as understanding textual changes in lists, tables, and plain text. Despite having some bugs that didn't associate with the major use cases, the library was chosen as it went above and beyond by capturing style changes.

                <h1>Learnings</h1>
                <br>
                Throughout this experience, I was able to work with various teams and learn many new things!
                This was my first expereince in the field of product management and a memorable one.
                I wore many different hates as I executed a feature from conception to development.
                <br><br>
                It was a very unique and different role than I was used to,
                 so I had to learn a lot while executing an essential feature. There was a lot of focus on communicating with different teams like
                 Sales, Marketing, Developers, and Product to ensure transparency and results. When I left this internship, the minimum viable feature was on beta and 
                 ready for testing and iteration. 
                 <br><br>
                 In the end, this was one of my favourite internships as it provided a foundation to understanding the role of a product manager and the importance of
                 product scoping, prioritization, and execution.
