                   The Weekly Check-in mobile product was a complex product set that was executed across multiple teams.
                   By the end of the internship, the weekly check-in features were planned for release including historical check-ins, which included previous conversations between
                   team lead and team member.
               <br>
               <br>
               I was tasked to launch and release most weekly check-in features by the end of my coop term. This involved working with senior engineers, collaborating with subject matter experts across the organization and working with designers to
               build out a synchronized cross-device experience for both mobile and web.

               <h1>Design Process</h1>
               <p class="section-text">Weekly Check-in consisted of various features which included a team member's ability to complete a check-in, the conversational experience
                   between a team member and their team leaders, and the ability to acknowledge and mark priorities as completed. In addtion to current check-ins, it was important to build
                   out the historical check-ins experience where a team lead and team manager can view past check-ins, but not have a conversational experience.
                   <br><br>
                   The sub-set of features included an end-to-end completion of weekly check-in, commenting and replying to an overall check-in or specific priorities, and
                   historical check-ins. I can speak to each part of the design process, but this would take all day!
                  
                   <br><br>
                  
                   So, check out the functionality study of the designs from a team member and team leader prespective which was helps understand the weekly check-in features!

                   <h1>Solution</h1><br>
                   Through design iteration and user experience studies, the weekly check-in feature was finally released. Once the code was shipped, I gathered feedback
                   from other product managers, studied the product myself, and got users to tinker with the Lifion app in order to iterate.
                   Through this we were able to add value to the product by ensuring users were engaged with the app for as long as possible.
                   <br><br>
                   One essential change made after the release included the navigation from a native screen once the back button was clicked.
                   A typical path would include a push notification which led the user to the native screen that the notifcation corresponded to, but once the user left the UI
                   the user would typically go to the inbox message UI where the rest of the messages could be viewed. As a product owner, I thought it was best to take users to their
                   weekly check-in screen in order to increase engagement and allow users to reflect on their weekly check-in submissions.
                   <br><br>
                   In this cross-functional team effort, I was able to work with two teams to deliever extensive features that many clients would soon implement.
                   From understanding mobile APIs, to how the logiflow designer would adapt to navigating to mobile native screens, I was the product owner and decision maker for weekly check-in.
                   Below is a video to describe the weekly check-in experience for a team member and team lead, and show the notifications and the inbox messaage UI.

                   <br><br>
  
                   The final solution included historical check-ins, current check-in, commenting and replying functionality, and a new UI called "Notifications".

                   <h1>Learnings</h1>
                   <br>
                   Throughout this experience, I was able to work with designers, product managers, developers, and my manager to create a product that would impact many.
 
                   <br><br>
                   It was a very unique experience as this was my first work experience in the mobile domain. There was a lot to learn about the complex product before making product decisions.
                   In the span of 4 months, I was able to understand the whole weekly check-in product by questions the product and its designs and functionality.
                   With that knowledge, I was able to plan out a roadmap with my manager to build new features to enhance the weekly check-in experience.
                   From UX bugs, to weekly check-in features, to release fixes, I was able to make decisions that impacted the product and its delievery.
                   <br><br>
                  
                   From this experience, I learned to build better products for the mobile space by considering empty states or error screens, handling network issues when the weekly check-in is only half completed, supporting emojis and dark mode, and
                   autoscrolling to comments and replies whether it be a previous check-in or the current check-in.
      
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, I was able to rapidly work with designers and developers to iterate and build out the product.
                    This internship was also unique because all the interns and I participated in innnovation week - a week-long event to build out amazing ideas that help the company.
                     In the end, there was a huge learning curve that I had overcome which allowed me to excel as a product owner!
